# JAVA-Hello-World-
A simple code in JAVA to output "Hello World" 
Since JAVA is an object oriented language, its consists of classes and methods(functions). This code has a class:"public class JavaApplications1", and a method:"public static void main(String[] args)", which contains the code we need executed, i.e, to output "Hello World". As this code doesn't need any external values and variables, a simple "String[] args" is added as a parameter. Finally, we write a function, "System.out.println()", to generate an output. Each line is ended by a ";".
